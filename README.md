# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Description: This includes a background map of Boston and real-time markers on where MBTA buses on a particular route are located. The locations of the markers is updated periodically by this script by accessing the MBTA bus location API.

How to Run: To run this project, open the index.html file in any browser and refresh.

Next Steps: I plan to play with changing the color of the background map, markers and also develop a similar map to other routes and other locations. Additional enhancements also can include legends to say the bus direction, nearest stop, time to next stop, available capacity, etc.
