# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Description: This includes a background map of Boston and a map marker that moves to show the movement of a bus between MIT and Harvard. 

How to Run: To run this project, open the index.html file in any browser and refresh.

Next Steps: I plan to play with changing the color of the background map and also develop a similar map to other routes and other locations.
